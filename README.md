# PlugApp Mobile

## Requirements

This is a 'tabs' starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

* Node.js
* Apache Cordova
* Ionic

## Run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/remkohdev/pluggapp_mobile.git
$ cd pluggapp_mobile
$ ionic serve
```

## Build

1. Create a new Ionic app with the tabs template
```bash
$ ionic create pluggapp_mobile tabs
```
2. Link to Ionic Cloud
```bash
$ ionic link
```
You can manage Ionic apps that are linked to the Ionic Cloud service in the [Ionic Apps Dashboard](https://apps.ionic.io/apps/). In the Ionic Apps Dashboard, click the Auth tab to add authenticated users.
3. Add [Ionic Services Auth](https://docs.ionic.io/services/auth/). [Basic navigation in Ionic2](https://www.joshmorony.com/a-simple-guide-to-navigation-in-ionic-2/) uses NavController. The Auth service is well explained in this blog [An example of the Ionic Auth service with Ionic2](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2016/11/04/an-example-of-the-ionic-auth-service-with-ionic-2) by Raymond Camden.
